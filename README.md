# Music-Theory-Calculator
This project is intended to provide useful tools on basic arranging/improvisation for contemporary music styles which contains features that are not typically available on mainstream music theory apps such as “musictheory.net”, since they are mostly based on the classical theory.
Features that are to be implemented:
1. Ability to create custom scale formulas and calculate all the modes of the scale
2. Given a key, Ability to find the available chord scales given the chord, function, and melodic information
3. Given a key, Ability to find all the common notes in the chord scales of given chords and chord scales.
4. Implement a graphical interface.

Current Progress:
7/21/2022: Started on the project, implemented basic methods in the Note Class.
7/28/2022: Started working on Interval Class, added new methods to Note Class, Note Class is mostly complete.
